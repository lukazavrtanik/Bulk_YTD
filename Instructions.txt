INSTRUCTIONS - HOW TO USE Bulk_YTD

0. Introduction:
	This code is designed to download videos from YouTube in bulk (and convert them to mp3, if the videos are actually songs)
	Input for this code is a YouTube search result (or basically any other YouTube page containing videos)
	The output is a semi-random set of videos. The results also might not be the same each time you run it, but precision and consistency was never the point anyways.

1. Scraping the website
	1.1. Open YouTube, use search, and scroll down the results to load more videos
	1.2. Press F12 to open the dev tools, and choose the "console" tab inside it
	1.3. Open "ScraperCode.txt", copy its contents into the console and press Enter
	1.4. A new tab with a bunch of text should appear - keep it open for later

2. Importing the data into Python
	2.1. Navigate to the folder containing Bulk_YTD.py (download it to a folder if you haven't already)
	2.2. Create a text file called "links.txt"
	2.3. Copy all the text from point 1.4. to "links.txt", save and close the file
	2.4. Run Bulk_YTD.py

3. Running the python code
	3.1. The code uses a bunch of libraries (see lines 1-5), make sure you install them beforehand
	3.2. Lines 7-20 are user input - read the comments inside the code
	3.3. Run the code. It will create a folder each time you run it, and save all the downloads in it
